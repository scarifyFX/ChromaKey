Turn "sky" off in video settings -> details. BUT "custom sky" keep on


In game, go to Video Settings - 
Shaders and down to the lower right of your screen should be Shader Options. 
Find Sky & Lighting
turn default skybox on, 
sky blur off, 
Shader Stars off, 
and Clouds off. 
Go to Video Settings - 
Details and make sure 
Sky, 
Stars, 
and Sun and Moon are all on 
(should be by default). 
Under Video Settings - Quality, 
make sure Custom Sky is on. That should be everything.
